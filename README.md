# Denver Crime - Open Source
I want to collect and publicly distribute a history of criminal offense in Denver, CO so that people know where they are more likely to encounter a specific threat.

This will utilize open-source data/crime statistics provided by the Denver Municipal Police Department for all years that data is available.
