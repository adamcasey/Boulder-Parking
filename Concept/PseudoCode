//Need to collect parking violations data from Boulder Municipal Police Department
//From that information, I'll sort the parking tickets into locations, days, and times of day
//Its algorithm will ultimately provide a numerical percentage that a person will receive a parking ticket
//The user won't have any real-time data or location tracking but will use this simply as a reference
